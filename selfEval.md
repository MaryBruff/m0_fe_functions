# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

    *I am most proud of just sticking to it and getting through it! The last two questions in the functions file stumped me. I realized at a certain point I was not being productive and went for a walk. When I came back I was like okay let me look at the lessons again and my notes. I think taking a break allowed me to just not think about what I was doing wrong. I came back with my blood pumping and things started to come together!*

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?

    *Functions are a powerful tool because they allow us to break down our code into a smaller set of instructions. When the code gets longer and more complicated it's easier to call out certain pieces of data and run them without having to change anything- thus saving time.*
